Project breakdown 

Overall view - 
 - the assignment requires a search bar element that auto fills 
 suggestions 
 - fruit array is provided in the project assignment
 - when typing, search bar should promt autofill suggestions 
 for fruits that contain the letters/words 
 - ex. app should promt fruit like apple and pineapple 

What we begin with - 
 - a search bar template is provided in the assignment folder 
 - script.js file and css file, needs completion

Ideas -
 - given that a search bar requires typing and keys being pressed
 event listners such as 'onkeypress', 'onsearch', and 'onsubmit' 
 may be useful for this assignment 


In process thoughs - 
1st commit - 
 - function searchHandler now collects user input and stores it 
 in an array 
 - it also logs in the console the typed character and the array
 in string form 
 - the function also removes the character if backspace is pressed

2nd commit - 
 - searchHandler function now calls search() function 
 - searchHandler logs the typed word in string form 
 - search function alters typedWord array to a string 
 - then, filters through the fruit array to see what fruit contains 
 the typedWord 
 - it logs the filtered results 

3rd commit - 
 - when filteredRes has the filtered words, it calls 
 the showSuggestions function to create li's for each 
 filteredRes word 
 - event listener is added to each li 
 - suggestions is now displayed on screen as a list 
 - removed useSuggestion function, it is not needed 
 - when suggestion is clicked, it replaces whatever is 
 in the search box 

4th commit - 
 - in this commit css is done for elements
 - search bar gets autofilled when suggestion is clicked 
 - hover effects over focused suggestion 

Overall strength and weakness -
 - confident in JS skills and workflow 
 - troubles with css and syling elements to work with one 
 another 
 - cutting down workflow to use less code 
 - possible issues with text elements that are not letters 
 - css stlying can cause problems if browser changes size etc 
 or a different device is used
