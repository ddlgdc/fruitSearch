Project breakdown 

Overall view - 
 - the assignment requires a search bar element that auto fills 
 suggestions 
 - fruit array is provided in the project assignment
 - when typing, search bar should promt autofill suggestions 
 for fruits that contain the letters/words 
 - ex. app should promt fruit like apple and pineapple 

What we begin with - 
 - a search bar template is provided in the assignment folder 
 - script.js file and css file, needs completion

Ideas -
 - given that a search bar requires typing and keys being pressed
 event listners such as 'onkeypress', 'onsearch', and 'onsubmit' 
 may be useful for this assignment 


In process thoughs - 
 - function searchHandler now collects user input and stores it 
 in an array 
 - it also logs in the console the typed character and the array
 in string form 
 - the function also removes the character if backspace is pressed
